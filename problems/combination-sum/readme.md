# Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), find all unique 
combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C **only once**.

Note:

+ All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
+ The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example
-------

For example, given candidate set `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7]` and target 7, the solution set is: 

```txt 
[
  [7],
  [6, 1]
]
```
