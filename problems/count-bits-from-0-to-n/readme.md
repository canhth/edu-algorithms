# Count Bits from 0 to N

Given a non negative integer number `num`. For every numbers `i` in the range `0 ≤ i ≤ num`
calculate the number of `1`'s in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example
-------

For num = 5 you should return `[0,1,1,2,1,2]`.

Follow up:

1. It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n), possibly in a single pass?
2. Space complexity should be O(n).
3. Do it without using any builtin functions to count bits in a programming language.
