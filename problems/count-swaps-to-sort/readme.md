# Count Swaps to Sort

Count the number of swaps of adjacent elements required to sort the array. Note that we can only
perform a swap operation on any two adjacent elements in the array.

Example
-------

```txt
[2,1,3,1,2] => 1 swap => [1,2,3,1,2] => 2 swaps => [1,1,2,3,2] => 1 swap => [1,1,2,2,3]
```
