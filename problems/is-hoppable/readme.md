# Is Hoppable

Given an 1D array, where each number represents the length you can hop to the left from this 
position to the right, determine whether you can hop out from this array.

Example
-------

Given `[5,2,0,0,3,1,0,4]`, return `true`.

You can hop from position `0` to position `4`, then from `4` to `7` and finally out from the array.
