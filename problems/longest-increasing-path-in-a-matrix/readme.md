Longest Increasing/Decreasing Path in a Matrix
----------------------------------------------

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example
-------

```javascript
nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

Return `4`, as the longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.
