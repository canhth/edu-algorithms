# Minimum Window Substring

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters 
in T. Time complexity should be O(n).

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string `""`. If 
there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique 
minimum window in S.

Example
-------

```javascript
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"

minWindow(S, T) === "BANC"
```
