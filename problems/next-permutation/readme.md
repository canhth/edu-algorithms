# Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater 
permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted 
in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.

Example
-------

```txt
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```
