# Serialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so 
that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link 
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can
be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example
-------

For example, you may serialize the following tree:

```txt
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

as `"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"`. But there may be a better way of serialization.
