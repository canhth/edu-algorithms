# Spiral Matrix

Given a NxM matrix, return its elements in a spiral order, staring at [0, 0] and moving clockwise.

Example
-------

```txt
[
  [1, 2, 3]
  [8, 9, 4]
  [7, 6, 5]
]
```

Must return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

Comments
--------

Instead of 4-loops solution, I made a border-looping solution which mady my day hard! :)
