# Strobogrammatic Numbers

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside 
down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.
Then write a function to generatee strobogrammatic numbers up to `n` digits.

Example
-------

For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic. "99", "66" and "123" are 
not.
