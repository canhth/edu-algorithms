# Target Sum

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2
signs + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new sign.

Find out how many ways to assign signs to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example
-------

```txt
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```
