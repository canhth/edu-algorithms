# Word Break

Given a non-empty string and a dictionary dict containing a list of non-empty words, determine
if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may
assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example
-------

```text
string = "bigbang"
dict = ["big", "bang"]
```

This should return `true` because `"bigbang"` can be constructed with words `"big"` and `"bang"`.
